# Goal üéØ
Perform various actions while exploring or in combat: run, hit, dash, heal yourself, and cast spells. Confront enemies with simple artificial intelligence and gaining levels to increase your power. All this under a ambient music and sound design.

If development proceeds quickly, it will also be possible to save your game, recording the level you were in before with your filled inventory. Perhaps even the possibility of solving sound-based puzzles to be replayed in order or to reconstitute an old statue to destroy.
